# What is SELinux?

**Definition:**

> Security Enhanced Linux or SELinux is an advanced access control mechanism built into most modern Linux distributions. It was initially developed by the US National Security Agency to protect computer systems from malicious intrusion and tampering. Over time, SELinux was released in the public domain and various distributions have since incorporated it in their code.

SELinux is a powerful tool for controlling what applications are allowed to do on your system. SELinux is a labeling system where every process and every object (files, directories, devices, network ports, etc.) gets a label. Then a large rules database, called policy, is loaded into the kernel. The kernel, based on the policy, controls what each process can do based on its label, and the label of the object it is trying to access. 

For example SELinux allows a process with the Apache label (httpd_t) to share data labeled as "read/only Apache content" (httpd_sys_content_thttpd_sys_content_rw_t). SELinux will block Apache processes from reading data labeled as user's home content (user_home_t) or database data (mysql_db_t). Apache processes can listen on ports labeled as the Apache port (http_port_t) but can not connect to the ports labeled as the mail port (smtp_port_t).

SELinux provides confinement on an application if the application has been hacked, even if the application is running as root. If policy says the (for example) Apache process is only supposed to read Apache content, then even if a hacker gets uid = 0 (the root user), he will not be able to turn it into a spam bot; he will not be able to read credit card data in your home directory; and he will not be able to destroy log files. The hacked process will only be able to act as an Apache process.

# SELinux Policy

SELinux allows different policies to be written that are interchangeable. The default policy in CentOS is the targeted policy which "targets" and confines selected system processes including httpd, named, dhcpd, mysqld, etc.


# Installing SELinux

```
yum install policycoreutils policycoreutils-python selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted libselinux-utils setroubleshoot-server setools setools-console mcstrans
```

Now we should have a system that's loaded with all the SELinux packages



## Setting up SELinux

**SELinux Modes**

Three possible modes:

- Enforcing: In enforcing mode SELinux will enforce its policy on the Linux system and make sure any unauthorized access attempts by users and processes are denied
- Permissive: Permissive mode is like a semi-enabled state.
- Disabled (not recommended):  the system won't be running with enhanced security.

### Checking yout SELinux status and modes

We can run the getenforce command:

```
getenforce
```

or

```
sestatus
```

What is your SELinux status? 

### Configuration file

The configuration file for SELinux is ``/etc/selinux/config``.

```
vi /etc/selinux/config
```

The output:

```
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#     enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#     permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#     disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=enforcing
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of three two values:
#     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
#     minimum - Modification of targeted policy. Only selected processes are protected.
#     mls - Multi Level Security protection.
SELINUXTYPE=targeted
```

So, here SELinux is ``enforcing``. And SELINUXTYPE directive is the policy that will be used. Here is targeted, so SELinux allows you to customize and fine tune access control permissions.

### Enabling / disabling SELinux

Modify file 

```
vi /etc/sysconfig/selinux
```

and modify:

```
...
SELINUX=permissive 
...
```

**permisive** will print warnings, but is not enforcing

with ``enforcing`` 

```
...
SELINUX=enforcing 
...
```

Setting the status to ``permissive`` first is necessary because every file in the system needs to have its context labelled before SELinux can be enforced.


Due to SELinux is loaded into the kernel :

```
reboot
```

Log as root and search for the string "SELinux is preventing" from the contents of the ``/var/log/messages file``.


```
cat /var/log/messages | grep "SELinux is preventing"
```

If there are no errors, we can safely move to the next step. However, it would still be a good idea to search for text containing "SELinux" in ``/var/log/messages` file. In our system, we ran the following command:

```
cat /var/log/messages | grep "SELinux"
```

And if everything went fine, change the SELINUX directive from permissive to enforcing in the `/etc/sysconfig/selinux` file:

```
...
SELINUX=enforcing
...
```

Reboot again: ``reboot``. After reboot check SELinux Status:

```
sestatus
```

or 

```
getenforce
```

# Troubleshooting with SELinux

There are a several reasons why SELinux may deny access to a file, process or resource:

- A mislabeled file.
- A process running under the wrong SELinux security context.
- A bug in policy. An application requires access to a file that wasn't anticipated when the policy was written and generates an error.
- An intrusion attempt.

## Checking SELinux logs

By default SELinux log messages are written to ```/var/log/audit/audit.log``` via the Linux Auditing System ``auditd``, which is started by default. If the auditd daemon is not running, then messages are written to ``/var/log/messages`` .


# Enable Apache Public HTML folder with SELinux


![SELinuxApache](https://sites.google.com/site/manuparra/home/selinux.png)

```
vi -w /etc/httpd/conf.d/userdir.conf
```

Change and include:

```
<IfModule mod_userdir.c>
    #
    # UserDir is disabled by default since it can confirm the presence
    # of a username on the system (depending on home directory
    # permissions).
    #
    UserDir enabled manuparra

    #
    # To enable requests to /~user/ to serve the user's public_html
    # directory, remove the "UserDir disabled" line above, and uncomment
    # the following line instead:
    #
    UserDir public_html

</IfModule>

<Directory /home/*/public_html>
        ## Apache 2.4 users use following ##
        AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit Indexes
        Options MultiViews Indexes SymLinksIfOwnerMatch IncludesNoExec
        Require method GET POST OPTIONS

        ## Apache 2.2 users use following ##
        Options Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks        
        AllowOverride All
        Allow from all
        Order deny,allow
</Directory>
```


To allow a few users to have UserDir directories, but not anyone else, use the following:

```
UserDir disabled
UserDir enabled testuser1 testuser2 testuser3
```


To allow most users to have UserDir directories, but deny this to a few, use the following:

```
UserDir enabled
UserDir disabled testuser4 testuser5 testuser6
```

Restart Apache ``service httpd restart`` .


Create a public_html folder for the user :

```
mkdir /home/manuparra/public_html
```

Change permissions to home:

```
chmod 711 /home/manuparra

chown manuparra:manuparra /home/manuparra/public_html
chmod 755 /home/manuparra/public_html
```

Set-up SELinux and Apache:

```
setsebool -P httpd_enable_homedirs true
chcon -R -t httpd_sys_content_t /home/manuparra/public_html
```

With ``chcon`` change the SELinux security context of each FILE to CONTEXT.

The ``chcon`` command changes the SELinux context for files. Changes made with the chcon command **do not survive** a file system relabel, or the execution of the restorecon command. SELinux policy controls whether users are able to modify the SELinux context for any given file. When using chcon, users provide all or part of the SELinux context to change. An incorrect file type is a common cause of SELinux denying access.

## Persistent context changes 

The ``semanage fcontext`` command is used to change the SELinux context of files. To show contexts to newly created files and directories, run the following command as root:

```
semanage fcontext -C -l
```


Changes made by ``semanage fcontext`` are used by the following utilities. The setfiles utility is used when a file system is relabeled and the restorecon utility restores the default SELinux contexts. This means that changes made by semanage fcontext are persistent, even if the file system is relabeled. SELinux policy controls whether users are able to modify the SELinux context for any given file.


```
semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_rw_t '/home/manuparra/public_html(/.*)?'

restorecon -R -v /home/manuparra/public_html
```

The first command uses ``semanage`` (SELinux Manage) with the ``fcontext`` command (File Context). We tell the system to add the SELinux type ``httpd_sys_content_rw_t`` type to the ``/home/manuparra/public_html`` directory and all of its children using the regular expression ``'/home/manuparra/public_html(/.*)?'``. Then running restorecon will actually change the labels on disk on all existing files and directories.

## SELinux and ports security

SELinux also controls network access. By default the Apache process is allowed to bind the ``http_port_t`` type. This type is defined for the following tcp ports:

``80,443, ...``

If you wanted to allow Apache to bind to tcp port 81, you would execute the following command:

```
semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 81
```

You can use the semanage port -l command to list all port definitions, or system-config-selinux.


# Users


First, let's create four user accounts to demonstrate SELinux capabilities as we go along.

```
regularuser
switcheduser
guestuser
restricteduser
```

You should currently be the root user. Let's run the following command to add the regularuser account:

```
useradd -c "Regular User" regularuser
```

Then we run the passwd command to change its password:

```
passwd regularuser
```

Do the same steps for each user, and then try:

```
ls -Z /home
```

Example role list:

- guest_u: This user doesn't have access to X-Window system (GUI) or networking and can't execute su / sudo command.
- xguest_u: This user has access to GUI tools and networking is available via Firefox browser.
- user_u: This user has more access than the guest accounts (GUI and networking), but can't switch users by running su or sudo.
- staff_u: Same rights as user_u, except it can execute sudo command to have root privileges.
- system_u: This user is meant for running system services and not to be mapped to regular user accounts.



SELinux users are different entities from normal Linux user accounts, including the root account. 

To view this mapping, we can run the semanage login -l command:

```
semanage login -l
```

To see what SELinux users are available in the system, we can run the semanage user command:

```
semanage user -l
```

Now from this table we can see the unconfined_u user is mapped to the system_r and unconfined_r roles. Although not evident here, SELinux policy actually allows these roles to run processes in the unconfined_t domain. Similarly, user sysadm_u is authorized for the sysadmr role, but guestu is mapped to guest_r role. Each of these roles will have different domains authorized for them.

Run:

```
id -Z
```


## Restricting Switched User Access


You don't want the user to be able to switch to other accounts, including the root account:

Log in with regularuser and try to switch to switcheduser:

```
[regularuser@localhost ~]$ su - switcheduser
Password:
[switcheduser@localhost ~]$
```

And now as root user (open another terminal):


```
semanage login -a -s user_u regularuser
```

Try login with user regularuser and run 


```
[regularuser@localhost ~]$ su - switcheduser

```

This is what we see now:

```
su: Authentication failure
```

If we now run the ``id -Z`` command again to see the SELinux context for regularuser, we will see the output is quite different from what we saw before: ``regularuser`` is now mapped to ``user_u``.

```
id -Z
```

Will return:
```
user_u:user_r:user_t:s0
```


## Restricting Permissions to Run Scripts

We can run the ``getsebool`` command to check the boolean value:

```
getsebool allow_guest_exec_content
```

```
semanage login -a -s guest_u guestuser
```

We can verify the action by running the semanage login -l command again:

```
semanage login -l
```


As we can see, guestuser is now mapped to the guest_u SELinux user account.

```
Login Name           SELinux User         MLS/MCS Range        Service
__default__          unconfined_u         s0-s0:c0.c1023       *
guestuser            guest_u              s0                   *
regularuser          user_u               s0                   *
root                 unconfined_u         s0-s0:c0.c1023       *
system_u             system_u             s0-s0:c0.c1023       *
```

Log in with guestuser:

```
[guestuser@localhost ~]$ pwd
```

You are in ``/home/guestuser/``


Create the script:

```
vi myscript.sh
```

with:

```
echo "This is a test script"
```

Make the script executable:

```
chmod u+x myscript.sh
```

Execute script:

```
 ~/myscript.sh
```

Next we go back to the ``root``  terminal window and change the boolean setting ``allow_guest_exec_content`` to ``off`` and verify it:

```
setsebool allow_guest_exec_content off
getsebool allow_guest_exec_content
```

Result:

```
guest\_exec\_content --> off
```

Return to the guestuser and try execute again:

```
 ~/myscript.sh
```

It produces:

```
-bash: /home/guestuser/myscript.sh: Permission denied
```

So this is how SELinux can apply an additional layer of security on top of DAC. Even when the user has full read, write, execute access to the script created in their own home directory, they can still be stopped from executing it.

Look at the ``/var/log/messages`` file.


## Restricting Access to Services

Firstly, stop apache service:

```
service httpd stop
```

Log in with restricted user and try:

```
id -Z

unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
```

So the account has the default behaviour of running as unconfined_u user and having access to unconfined_r role. However, this account does not have the right to start any processes within the system. 


The following code block shows that restricteduser is trying to start the httpd daemon and getting an access denied error:

```
[restricteduser@localhost ~]$ service httpd start
Redirecting to /bin/systemctl start  httpd.service
Failed to issue method call: Access denied
```

Next we move back to the root user terminal window and make sure the restricteduser account has been added to the /etc/sudoers file. 

```
visudo
```


Edit and save:

```
...
restricteduser ALL=(ALL)      ALL
...
```

If we now log out of the restricteduser terminal window and log back in again, we can start and stop the httpd service with sudo privileges:

```
[restricteduser@localhost ~]$ sudo service httpd start
```

The user can also stop the service now:

```
[restricteduser@localhost ~]$ sudo service httpd stop
```

That's all very normal: system administrators give sudo access to user accounts they trust. But what if you want to stop this particular user from starting the httpd service even when the user's account is listed in the sudoers file?.


```
semanage login -a -s user_u restricteduser
```

Now that restricteduser has been restricted to user_u (and that means to role user_r and domain user_t), we can verify its access using the seinfo command from our root user's window:



```
seinfo -uuser_u -x
```


The output shows the roles user_u can assume. These are object_r and user_r:

```
   user_u
      default level: s0
      range: s0
      roles:
         object_r
         user_r
```


Taking it one step further, we can run the seinfo command to check what domains the user_r role is authorized to enter:

```
seinfo -ruser_r -x
```

Looking for httpd services:


```
seinfo -ruser_r -x | grep httpd
```

Taking this example then, if the restricteduser account tries to start the httpd daemon, the access should be denied because the httpd process runs within the httpd_t domain and that's not one of the domains the user_r role is authorized to access. And we know user_u (mapped to restricteduser) can assume user_r role. This should fail even if the restricteduser account has been granted sudo privilege.


Going back to the restricteduser account's terminal window, we try to start the httpd daemon now (we were able to stop it before because the account was granted sudo privilege):

```
[restricteduser@localhost ~]$ sudo service httpd start

```
The access is denied:

```
sudo: PERM_SUDOERS: setresuid(-1, 1, -1): Operation not permitted
```
